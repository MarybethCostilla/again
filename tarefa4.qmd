  Due to increasing algae bloom occurrence and water degradation on a global scale, there is a demand for water quality monitoring systems based on remote sensing imagery. This paper describes the scientific, theoretical, and methodological background for creating a cloud-computing interface on Google Earth Engine (GEE) which allows end-users to access algae bloom related products with high spatial (30 m) and temporal (~5 day) resolution. The proposed methodology uses Sentinel-2 images corrected for atmospheric and sun-glint effects to generate an image collection of the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll-a Index (NDCI) for the entire time-series. NDCI is used to estimate both Chl-a concentration, based on a non-linear fitting model, and Trophic State Index (TSI), based on a tree-decision model classification into five classes. Once the Chl-a and TSI algorithms had been calibrated and validated they were implemented in GEE as an Earth Engine App, entitled Algae Bloom Monitoring Application (AlgaeMAp). AlgaeMAp is the first online platform built within the GEE platform that offers high spatial resolution of water quality parameters. The App benefits from the huge processing capability of GEE that allows any user with internet access to easily extract detailed spatial (30 m) and long temporal Chl-a and TSI information (from August 2015 and with images every 5 days) throughout the most important reservoirs in the State of São Paulo/Brazil. The application will be adapted to extend to other relevant areas in Latin America.

## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Human activities on a global scale have significantly contributed to the degradation of the water quality of inland aquatic systems by increasing their nutrient levels. Particularly, reservoirs are under high pressure due to the increasing water demand for urban areas, including irrigation, industrial use, and energy production, while still needing to maintain their ecological function. The quasi-lentic nature of reservoirs leads to a higher phosphorus accumulation, which may trigger phytoplankton production, abundance, and frequency of algae blooms. Algae bloom (AB) is a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of algae, characterized by the blue-green water coloration caused by algae’s pigments, that can cause serious consequences to human health and aquatic biogeochemistry due to the production of toxins. The increase in aquatic ecosystems’ productivity has been monitored by a series of different Trophic State Indexes (TSIs) based on information regarding the nutrient input (generally, phosphorus), water transparency (usually Secchi depth), and chlorophyll concentration (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass). More specifically, the objective is to calibrate and validate predictive algorithms for Chlorophyll-a and Trophic State Index classes using both in situ data and Sentinel-2/MSI data available in Google Earth Engine. Once parametrized, these predictive algorithms were implemented in the GEE App to compute the spatial and temporal variation of Chl-a concentration and TSI classes. This paper gives the theoretical and methodological background supporting the tool’s development and reports the first results of their application to the monitoring of Tietê River Basin, located in the State of São Paulo, Brazil (Figure 1).

- Note that figures and tables (such as @fig-first and @tbl-one) should appear in the paper, not at the end or in separate files.
- In document front matter, you may set the key `blinded` under a `journal` key to hide the authors and acknowledgements, producing the required anonymized version.
- Remember that in the anonymized version, you should not identify authors indirectly in the text.  That is, don't say "In Smith et. al.  (2009) we showed that ...". Instead, say "Smith et. al. (2009) showed that ...".
- These points are only intended to remind you of some requirements.
